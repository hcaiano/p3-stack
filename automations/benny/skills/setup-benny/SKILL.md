# Set up Benny

Benny ships as a dormant automation pack inside p3-stack. Only pstack's normal skill root is installed; this file and the two operational files are not slash skills.

The human enters setup by pointing T3 Code at the pack's `FOR_AGENTS.md`. The bootstrap flow copies the whole pack into the target repository, then reads this file directly at `.agents/automations/benny/skills/setup-benny/SKILL.md`.

Benny needs external configuration and two live T3 automations.

Activation BLOCKED. This is a dormant T3 port. No equivalent has been established for the creation-only reviewed Automations editor handoff, per-automation tool permissions, or child Slack write isolation. A reviewed T3 setup handoff below names a required capability, not a callable tool or installed skill. Prepare complete reviewable drafts and leave activation blocked until those capabilities are proven.

Do not create or update an automation until the user explicitly asks. Never put a secret value in plugin files, prompts, or committed configuration.

## 1. Copy the pack and enable shared pstack skills

Do this before asking for Benny configuration and before the reviewed T3 setup handoff.

Ask which repository will run the automations. The source pack is the directory containing `FOR_AGENTS.md`. The destination is `<target-repository>/.agents/automations/benny/`.

Merge the entire source pack into the destination:

1. Create the destination when it is absent.
2. Copy every source file to the same relative path.
3. Preserve destination-only files. Never delete unrelated files during install or refresh.
4. Keep user-owned configuration, feature maps, and routing maps outside the destination. Never overwrite them.
5. When an existing source-managed file differs, inspect the diff and merge without discarding local edits. If ownership is ambiguous, stop and ask before replacing it.
6. Verify that the destination contains `FOR_AGENTS.md`, this setup file, both operational files, their references, and the templates.

If this file is already being read from the target destination, treat the copy as complete and run the same verification before continuing.

Install pstack's shared skills in the target repository's `.agents/skills/` through the approved fork installer and `npx skills@latest`.

Use an installer checkout at the same approved full 40-character commit as `https://github.com/hcaiano/p3-stack/tree/<approved-40-character-commit>`. Confirm that the checkout matches that revision before installation.

Run that checkout's `./install.sh --dry-run --project <target-repository> --source <approved-commit-URL>` first. Review its ownership checks and selected skills before running the same command without `--dry-run`. Use `--update` only for skills whose `skills-lock.json` entry proves this fork owns them. Preserve every unrelated installed skill and an existing upstream `unslop`. Stop on an ownership collision. Never hand-edit installed third-party skills.

Reload the target project or start a fresh agent rooted there. Verify that these shared pstack skills resolve from project scope:

- `how`
- `why`
- `tdd`
- `unslop`
- `principle-separate-before-serializing-shared-state`
- `principle-minimize-reader-load`
- `principle-guard-the-context-window`
- `principle-sequence-verifiable-units`
- `principle-fix-root-causes`
- `principle-prove-it-works`

Do not count a skill loaded from the current session or a user-scoped install. The check must show that a fresh agent in the target repository receives pstack through its project-scoped installation.

If project-scoped skill installation is unavailable or any shared dependency does not resolve, stop and explain the failure.

The Benny files are read directly from `.agents/automations/benny/`. Do not install that directory as registered skills or expect its `SKILL.md` files to appear in the slash-skill list.

Tell the user that `.agents/skills/`, `skills-lock.json`, `.agents/automations/benny/`, and any referenced secret-free configuration must be committed before either automation is enabled. Do not commit them unless the user asks.

Once this check passes, live automation prompts may read the committed operational files by their stable repository-relative paths. They must not embed a plugin cache path or copy the file contents.

## 2. Adapt the configuration

Open these copied examples:

- `../../templates/configuration.example.yaml`
- `../reproduce-and-fix-issues/references/feature-map.example.md`

Create user-owned copies outside `.agents/automations/benny/`. These are configuration files, not pack files. Example locations:

- Project config, such as `.agents/benny/configuration.yaml`
- Project feature map, such as `.agents/benny/feature-map.md`
- Project routing map, such as `.agents/benny/routing.md`
- User config, such as `~/.config/benny/configuration.yaml`
- User feature map, such as `~/.config/benny/feature-map.md`

Fill one feature-map section for every user-facing feature the automation may reproduce. Keep it at the user point of view. Do not freeze implementation details or current code paths in the map.

Do not edit the copied examples. Pack refreshes may update source-managed files after conflict review, but they must never touch the user-owned copies.

Prefer committed, secret-free files in the target repository when a fresh automation checkout must read them. Otherwise paraphrase the required values into the live prompt. Reference a repository file only after the reviewed T3 setup handoff confirms that the file is committed in the repository where the automation runs.

Use stable repository-relative paths for committed pack and configuration files. Never reference the plugin source directory or a plugin cache path from a live automation.

## 3. Fill the required choices

Ask for or confirm:

- Source Slack channel ID
- Optional operations or status channel ID
- Repository URL and default branch
- Triage identity or Slack user ID
- Issue tracker type, team, project, labels, and intake status
- Tracker adapter skill or MCP actions
- Optional routing map path
- Required control skill name
- Required user-facing feature-map path
- Status emoji strings
- Pull request URL format
- Polling and effort budgets
- Model IDs and supported reasoning-effort options for triage, repro, code work, and media review

Retain the configuration model roles `triage`, `reproduce`, `code`, and `media_review`. Read the project-scoped `.agents/skills/poteto-mode/references/t3-execution.md`. Resolve provider instances, model IDs, supported effort options, and accounts through `orchestrator_capabilities` and that shared adapter. Do not hardcode a model slug or carry over a private default.

The source channel, triage identity, repository, tracker adapter, control skill, and feature map must be explicit. Fail setup if any required value stays ambiguous.

Use pstack's `unslop` skill on the final automation names, descriptions, and prompt shims before saving them.

## 4. Check integration capabilities

The triage automation needs:

- Read access to the configured source Slack channel and its threads
- Thread-reply access in that channel
- Attachment metadata and file download access when reports include media
- Search, read, create, and update access through the configured issue-tracker adapter

The repro automation needs:

- Read access to the source thread
- Thread-reply access in the source channel
- Optional post and edit access in the configured operations channel
- Repository read and history access
- A pull request action that can open a draft pull request
- The configured control-adapter skill

Prefer configured connected Slack actions for reads and posts. The optional `BENNY_SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` may fill a narrow gap such as editing one operations status message or downloading an attachment. Store the value in a secret manager or environment, not in YAML.

Require per-automation tool permissions and proof that delegated workers cannot use Slack write actions or receive Slack credentials. If either boundary is unavailable or unproved, leave both automations disabled.

Do not use undocumented integration endpoints.

## 5. Prepare the routing map

If the user wants reroutes or owner pings:

1. Copy `../triage-issue-reports/references/routing.example.md` outside `.agents/automations/benny/`.
2. Replace every placeholder with public or organization-local values.
3. Keep owner pings off by default.
4. Allow a ping only for a configured feature owner or a confirmed likely regression author.

If no routing map is configured, triage may classify a report but must not guess a destination or owner.

## 6. Verify the control adapter

Read `../reproduce-and-fix-issues/references/control-adapter.md` and the user's completed feature map.

Confirm that the named skill can:

- Bring up the target app
- Navigate every mapped feature through the real UI
- Exercise mapped states through declared adapter actions
- Inspect state without forcing the result
- Capture screenshots
- Start and stop a recording
- Clean up its processes and temporary data

If any capability is missing, leave the repro automation disabled. It must fail closed rather than claim a reproduction it did not perform.

## 7. Prepare the live automations

Ask whether this is first-time creation or configuration of existing automations.

Read `../../FOR_AGENTS.md` from the copied pack as the primary user-intent source for either path. Use it to understand the two triggers, tools, instructions, outcomes, and shared rules.

### First-time creation

Create one automation at a time.

For each automation:

1. Read the matching copied prompt template as secondary internal source material.
2. Turn `FOR_AGENTS.md`, the finished Benny configuration, and the template intent into a complete natural-language request.
3. Tell the live prompt to read and follow its exact committed operational file under `.agents/automations/benny/`.
4. Use the stable repository-relative path, not a plugin source or cache path. Do not copy the operational file contents into the live prompt.
5. Require the creation-only reviewed T3 setup handoff.
6. Let the reviewed T3 setup handoff discover Slack channels, the repository, and connected integrations.
7. Let the reviewed T3 setup handoff confirm that the copied pack and any referenced configuration files are committed in the same repository where the automation will run.
8. Let the reviewed T3 setup handoff show its draft table, obtain approval, ask readiness, and open the Automations editor.
9. Finish the editor handoff for this automation before starting the next one.

Prepare this complete triage intent for the reviewed T3 setup handoff, filled from configuration:

- Name `benny-triage`.
- Read and follow `.agents/automations/benny/skills/triage-issue-reports/SKILL.md` for every run.
- Trigger on each new top-level report in the configured source Slack channel.
- Read the triggering thread and reply only inside it.
- Use the configured issue-tracker integration.
- Classify, inspect evidence, trace cause, dedupe, and create only clear new bugs.
- End one thread-only verdict with the configured `[benny:bug]`, `[benny:performance]`, or `[benny:other]` marker and optional tracker URL.
- Never post a source-channel root message.

After the triage editor handoff is complete, prepare this complete repro and fix intent for the reviewed T3 setup handoff:

- Name `benny-reproduce`.
- Read and follow `.agents/automations/benny/skills/reproduce-and-fix-issues/SKILL.md` for every run.
- Trigger on the same new top-level reports in the configured source Slack channel.
- Use the configured repository and default branch.
- Read the source thread and reply only inside it.
- Include pull request creation and the configured tracker, control-adapter, and feature-map requirements. Paraphrase mapped user paths and states unless the reviewed T3 setup handoff confirms an eligible committed file in the same repository.
- Wait for a trusted triage marker before acting.
- Reproduce the exact symptom twice through the mapped real UI and capture evidence.
- Verify an existing fix without authoring over it.
- Attempt an optional bounded fix only after confirmed repro, then open a draft pull request when proof and checks pass. Use `review-it` before opening or updating the pull request and `write-pr` for its title and body.
- Never post a source-channel root message.

Do not duplicate the reviewed T3 setup handoff's Slack, repository, integration, completeness, authentication, draft-review, approval, readiness, or editor-handoff work.

Draft preparation does not satisfy an editor handoff. If the required capability is unavailable, stop with the complete reviewable draft, its required integration permissions, and the unmet readiness checks.

### Existing automations

The reviewed T3 setup handoff is creation-only. Do not use it to search for, inspect, or update existing automations.

Finish configuration, routing, control-adapter, and feature-map validation. Then give the user this concise editor checklist.

For the existing triage automation, update:

- Name and description
- Direct instruction to read `.agents/automations/benny/skills/triage-issue-reports/SKILL.md`
- New top-level Slack report trigger and source channel
- Slack thread read and reply capabilities
- Issue-tracker integration
- Paraphrased triage instructions, thread-only rule, and Benny verdict markers

For the existing repro automation, update:

- Name and description
- Direct instruction to read `.agents/automations/benny/skills/reproduce-and-fix-issues/SKILL.md`
- Matching Slack trigger and source channel
- Repository and default branch
- Slack thread read and reply capabilities
- Pull request action
- Tracker, control-adapter, and feature-map requirements
- Paraphrased marker wait, evidence, verification, and bounded-fix instructions

Ask the user to update each existing automation directly in its Automations editor. Do not create replacements or duplicates.

### Creation boundary

Never call a direct automation backend service or backend automation tool. Never use a browser URL that carries draft fields. Never use a protocol deep link to bypass the reviewed editor handoff. For new automations, the only finish path is the reviewed T3 setup handoff through the Automations editor.

Do not call `schedule_task` or `update_scheduled_task` to create, update, or activate Benny. A backend scheduling call does not establish the required reviewed editor handoff, per-automation tool permissions, or child Slack write isolation. Until a proven equivalent exists, leave activation BLOCKED and hand the reviewable draft to the operator.

Do not enable either automation until the thread-safety test passes after the editor save.

## 8. Test thread safety

Use a test channel or a harmless test report.

Before testing, confirm that the target repository's `.agents/skills/`, `skills-lock.json`, `.agents/automations/benny/`, and every referenced secret-free configuration file are committed on the branch used by the automation checkout. Confirm that both live prompts point at their exact committed operational files. If any check fails, stop. Tell the user that the automation cannot be enabled yet.

Verify:

1. Triage stores the root `thread_ts` and posts exactly one verdict as a reply.
2. The verdict contains one configured marker.
3. Repro accepts the marker only from the configured triage identity.
4. Repro keeps the same immutable source coordinates.
5. No source-channel root message appears.
6. A delegated worker cannot use any Slack write action.
7. Missing coordinates, a deleted parent, or a failed preflight produces no post and no tracker issue.

Enable normal traffic only after all seven checks pass.
